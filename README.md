# Strategic Supplier Risk Report

This project analyzes supplier performance and risk using a Tableau workbook titled **Procurement and Supply-Chain Strategy**. The goal is to identify key suppliers, assess risks across categories (strategic, leverage, bottleneck), and recommend mitigation strategies for high-risk dependencies.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **High-impact suppliers** (e.g., lithium batteries, rare earth materials) are single-sourced and pose major disruption risk.
- **Delivery reliability** and **cost variance** are performance concerns, especially for strategic items with long lead times.
- **Geopolitical exposure** to China and other regions heightens risk, particularly for bottleneck and strategic supplies.
- Recommendations include:
  - Dual sourcing of critical items
  - Inventory buffers for long-lead parts
  - Proactive supplier risk monitoring
  - Regional diversification and mapping multi-tier dependencies
