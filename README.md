## Strategic Supplier Risk & Procurement Analysis

This project analyzes procurement data using the Kraljic Matrix segmentation and evaluates key supplier risk across several performance dimensions, including on-time delivery, quality (defect rate), and cost variance. A visual summary is presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, while a detailed report outlines supplier segmentation, risk mitigation strategies, and performance observations.

### 📊 Visual Summary
- **Tableau Dashboard**: [Procurement and Supply Strategy Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ProcurementandSupply-ChainStrategy/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))  
  _You can also download the dashboard from the `.twbx` file in this repo._

  A full business analysis report highlighting key findings and actionable risk mitigation strategies.

### 📁 Files Included
- `Procurement and Supply-Chain Strategy.twbx` – Tableau workbook with dashboards.

### 🧠 Key Insights
- Strategic suppliers (e.g., sole-source battery and chipset providers) present high risk due to dependency and long lead times.
- Bottleneck items sourced from geopolitically sensitive regions raise concern for rare earth metals.
- Leverage suppliers (e.g., steel providers) offer cost stability but must still be monitored for spend concentration.
- Recommendations include dual sourcing, inventory buffers, supplier risk tracking, and regional diversification.

> This project demonstrates procurement risk assessment and visualization as part of a larger supply chain strategy initiative.
